<h2>Simulation</h2>

<p>
If the capabilities of the (extended) Erlang-C formula and the (extended) Allen-Cunneen approximation formula
are not sufficient anymore to model a queueing system, simulation tools can be used. In the past, the advantage
of the above analytical formulas was that, unlike simulations, they could produce results quickly; the run times
of comparable simulations were in the range of hours to days. In the meantime, even the computing power of
smartphones is sufficient to calculate the characteristics of complex models within a few seconds (see the
web-based <b>Mini Simulator (Webapp)</b> and <b>Mini Warteschlangensimulator (Webapp)</b>, which also run on
cell phones and tablets).
</p>

<p>
The desktop simulation tools offered on this page are all free or open source solutions. While the Mini Simulator
and the Mini Warteschlangensimulator are a web app that runs directly in the browser, the other three simulators
require a Windows, Linux or MacOS computer. The three simulators are built on the Java platform and therefore
require the installation of a <a href="https://adoptium.net/" target="_blank">Java runtime environment</a>.
</p>

<p>
The most powerful tool offered here is the <b>Warteschlangensimulator</b>. This allows to represent arbitrarily
complex models in the form of flow charts.  All properties that Erlang-C and Allen-Cunneen formulas can represent
(arbitrary probability distributions, batch arrivals and service, impatience, operator downtimes) are of course
also available in Warteschlangensimulator. In addition, a large number of other properties can be taken into account.
All three Java-based   simulators also have a fully automatic, very extensive statistics recording, which goes far
beyond the output in this queue calculator web app.

        <p class="card-text">Warteschlangensimulator allows the simulation of arbitrary, complex queue networks. The models are defined in Warteschlangensimulator in the form of <b>flow charts</b>. Optionally, an <b>animation</b> illustrating the movement of clients through the system can be displayed during the simulation of the model. Parameter series can be automatically created for automated examination of different models, and an optimizer is also available. Furthermore, external data sources can be directly connected during the simulation of models and also (partial) results can be directly transferred to external programs (e.g. databases).</p>

        <p class="card-text">Mini Warteschlangensimulator allows the animation and simulation of simple queue networks directly in the web browser. The models are defined in Mini Warteschlangensimulator in the form of flowcharts. The simulation runs completely client-side in the browser, without any support from a server.</p>

        <h4 class="card-title">Callcenter Simulator</h4>
        <p class="card-text">Callcenter Simulator is designed to represent <b>real call center systems</b> consisting of multiple sub-call centers, different caller groups, different agent groups (with different skill levels and different shift schedules), complex routing rules, etc. It can be used directly for staffing requirements planning and for analyzing possible control strategies in large call center networks. Beyond pure simulation, the program also provides functions for automatic optimization of the number of agents per time interval.</p>

        <h4 class="card-title">Mini Callcenter Simulator</h4>
        <p class="card-text">Mini Callcenter Simulator essentially replicates the same <b>G/G/c/K+G model</b> that this simulator features. However, it has many more probability distributions that can be used for inter-arrival, service time, post-processing time, waiting time tolerance, and retry distance distributions. Also, many more characteristics are recorded and various export options are available for the simulation results. Furthermore, the simulation results can be directly be compared with corresponding <b>Erlang-C</b> results and explanations can be displayed as to why deviations occur at which points.</p>

        <p class="card-text">The Mini Simulator, just like this queue calculator, is a webapp that runs directly in the browser. It maps a <b>G/G/c/K+G model</b>, i.e., unlike this calculator, it can handle different probability distributions and can map repeaters and forwarding.</p>
